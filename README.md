🆘 Disaster Tweet Classification using Traditional Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

📌 Project Overview
Natural disasters can occur unexpectedly, making rapid response crucial. While official channels may delay information, social media—particularly Twitter—can provide real-time updates from the public. However, this data is often noisy, unstructured, and difficult to interpret quickly.

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to build a binary classification model that determines whether a tweet is about a disaster or not. Both traditional machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and deep learning models (e.g., BiLSTM, GRU) were evaluated.

🔍 Best Performing Model:
Logistic Regression outperformed all other models in terms of accuracy and reliability for disaster tweet classification.
