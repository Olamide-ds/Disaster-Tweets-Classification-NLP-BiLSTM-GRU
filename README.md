# Disaster-Tweets-NLP
🆘 Disaster Tweet Classification using NLP

📌 Project Overview

Natural disasters often strike without warning, and timely response is critical. While official disaster data is not always immediately available, social media platforms like Twitter serve as rapid, real-time sources of public information. However, sorting through this massive influx of noisy, unstructured data poses a significant challenge.

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a tweet is related to a disaster or not. By leveraging deep learning models like BiLSTM and GRU and traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression, the project aims to address the challenge of ambiguity in text and support real-time disaster response.

🎯 Objective

- Automatically identify disaster-related tweets.

- Assist first responders and humanitarian organizations by filtering relevant information from noise.

- Demonstrate how NLP can aid in situational awareness during emergencies.

🧠 Why It Matters

Between 2000 and 2019, over 7,000 major disasters impacted billions of lives. Meanwhile, Twitter generates half a billion tweets per day, many of which are shared during crises. Fast and accurate classification of these tweets can save lives, reduce misinformation, and streamline relief efforts.

🔍 Key Features

- Preprocessing of noisy and unstructured tweet data

- Traditional machine learning and Deep learning models to handle context and ambiguity

- Classify tweets that are disaster related or not
